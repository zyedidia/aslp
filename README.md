# *ASLp* - ASL Partial Evaluator

This forks ASLi to extract usable semantics from the 
architecture specifications. 
The semantics produced are in ASL but are reduced to contain 
only simple control flow and scalar types, 
for use in further static analysis.

## Introduction

Example implementation of Arm's Architecture Specification Language (ASL).

The ASL interpreter is a collection of resources to help you to
understand and make use of Arm's architecture specifications.
It consists of lexer, parser, typechecker and interpreter for the ASL language
and an interactive interface for evaluating ASL statements and expressions.

There is a [blog post](https://alastairreid.github.io/using-asli/)
describing how to use ASLi with Arm's v8.6-A ISA specification.

## Requirements

To build and run the ASL interpreter, you will need:

  * OCaml version 4.09 or later
  * OPAM OCaml version 2.0.5 (other versions may work)
  * The following OPAM packages
      * ocaml     - OCaml compiler
      * odoc      - OCaml documentation generator (optional)
      * dune      - OCaml build system
      * menhir    - parser generator tool
      * ott       - tool for defining language grammars and semantics 
      * linenoise - OCaml line editing library
      * pprint    - OCaml pretty-printing library
      * z3        - OCaml bindings for the Z3 SMT solver 
      * zarith    - OCaml multiprecision arithmetic library

### Installing with Nix

ASLp can be installed as a Nix package from https://github.com/katrinafyi/pac-nix.
_asli_ provides the base ASLp and _aslp_ provides ASLp bundled with ARM's specifications.
If you don't plan on modifying the tool, this is a fast and easy way to get started.

### Installing dependencies

Platform specific instructions:
```
    MacOS:
        brew install opam
        brew install gmp mpir
    Ubuntu:
        sudo apt-get install opam libpcre3-dev
    OpenSUSE:
        sudo zypper install ocaml opam ocaml-ocaml-compiler-libs-devel
```

Platform independent instructions:

```
    # Install dependencies from asli.opam file
    opam install --deps-only --with-test ./asli.opam

    # the following are optional and only needed if modifying asli code
    opam install odoc
    opam install ocamlformat

    # On OSX, you may need to use this command to install zarith
    env CFLAGS="-I$HOME/homebrew/include/" LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/homebrew/lib/" opam install zarith

    eval `opam config env`
```

You also need to execute this command

```
    MacOS: export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=`opam config var z3:lib`
    Linux: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`opam config var z3:lib`
```


### Building

To build the ASL lexer and ASL interpreter, execute this command.

```
    make install
```

If you get a lot of linker errors involving Z3, double-check that you installed
the right version.

### Using ASL lexer

This displays a list of tokens in an ASL file including the indent
and dedent tokens used to support indentation-based parsing.

```
    $ dune exec bin/testlexer.exe prelude.asl
```

### Using ASL interpreter

This reads ASL files specified on the command line and
provides an interactive environment for executing ASL
statements and expressions.

```

### Using the ASL partial evaluator

Arm's specification files are shipped with the ASLp fork in the mra_tools/ subfolder.
We also define a small number of overrides in tests/override.asl and tests/override.prj.
These provide alternative but equivalent definitions of some pre-defined functions
which are more suitable for partial evaluation.
(See [alastairreid/asl-interpreter](https://github.com/alastairreid/asl-interpreter#using-asl-interpreter-with-arms-public-specifications) for more details.)

There is a script `./asli` which will load the required files.
For example, to print the partially-evaluated semantics of the `add x1, x2, x3, LSL 4` instruction:
```bash
$ ./asli
ASLi> :sem A64 0x8b031041
Decoding instruction A64 8b031041
__array _R [ 1 ] = add_bits.0 {{ 64 }} (
    __array _R [ 2 ] [ 0 +: 64 ],
    append_bits.0 {{ 60,4 }} ( __array _R [ 3 ] [ 0 +: 60 ],'0000' ) 
) [ 0 +: 64 ] ;
ASLi> 
```
LLVM can be used to obtain the bytecode for a particular instruction mnemonic:
```bash
$ echo 'add x1, x2, x3, LSL 4' | 
    clang -x assembler -target aarch64 - -c -o/dev/stdout |
    llvm-objdump - -d --section=.text |
    tail -n1
0: 8b031041      add     x1, x2, x3, lsl #4
```

The interpreter's evaluation (inherited from the original ASLi) can be tested with these commands:
```
:init globals
:init regs
:set +eval:concrete_unknown
:project tests/test.prj
```

This test program prints the line "Test" so you should see output like this
```
ASLi> :project tests/test.prj
Loading ELF file tests/test_O2.elf.
Entry point = 0x400168
Test
Program exited by writing ^D to TUBE
Exception taken
```

Finally, the `:coverage` command is used to test equivalence of the partial evaluator and the interpreter.
It takes a regular expression of an instruction group, then generates and evaluates the partially evaluated
ASL as well as the original ASL and compares the final states. 
Instruction groups can be found in the [mra_tools/arch/arch_instrs.asl](mra_tools/arch/arch_instrs.asl) file.
```
ASLi> :coverage A64 aarch64_integer.+

0x1ac04c3f: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=0 ; sz=3 ; Rn=1 ; Rd=31] --> UNDEFINED (file "./mra_tools/arch/arch_decode.asl" line 3715 char 66 - line 3716 char 28)
0x1ac04fe0: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=0 ; sz=3 ; Rn=31 ; Rd=0] --> UNDEFINED (file "./mra_tools/arch/arch_decode.asl" line 3715 char 66 - line 3716 char 28)

0x1ac04fff: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=0 ; sz=3 ; Rn=31 ; Rd=31] --> UNDEFINED (file "./mra_tools/arch/arch_decode.asl" line 3715 char 66 - line 3716 char 28)
0x1ac05000: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=1 ; sz=0 ; Rn=0 ; Rd=0] --> OK
0x1ac05001: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=1 ; sz=0 ; Rn=0 ; Rd=1] --> OK
0x1ac0501f: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=1 ; sz=0 ; Rn=0 ; Rd=31] --> OK
0x1ac05020: [sf=0 ; Rm=0 ; C=1 ; sz=0 ; Rn=1 ; Rd=0] --> OK
[...]
```

"OK" indicates the machine state after both executions are the same, 
as we would expect if the partial evaluation is correct.
UNDEFINED means that particular bytecode is an undefined case in the architecture.
If an exception occurs somewhere else in the process, that will be reported as well.

Enjoy!
